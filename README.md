# Unit Converter

A Chrome extension for imperial to international unit conversion.

The extension scans the whole page for imperial units. In case of a match the unit is converted and inserted as a \<span>-Element. The element is marked with a dotted underline and if you hover the mouse over the imperial unit, the converted international unit is displayed.

As of now this extension supports only pound-to-kilogramm conversion. More units to be added.
